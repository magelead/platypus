01 Prerequisites,/ch-prerequisites,"This is a comprehensive guide for setting up your environment on your
personal computer for working with Qiskit Textbook. This will help you
reproduce the results as you see them on the textbook website. The
Qiskit Textbook is written in Jupyter Notebooks.

02 Quantum states and qubits,/ch-states,"If you think quantum mechanics sounds challenging, you’re not alone.
Our intuitions come from day-to-day experiences, and so are better at
understanding the behavior of balls and bananas than atoms or
electrons. Though quantum objects can seem random and chaotic at first,
they just follow a different set of rules. Once we know what those
rules are, we can use them to create new and powerful technology.
Quantum computing will be the most revolutionary example of this.

03 Multiple qubits and entanglement,/ch-gates,"We've seen some interesting effects with isolated qubits and single
qubit gates, but the true power of quantum computing comes from
interactions between qubits. In this section we will introduce multiple
qubit gates and explore the interesting behaviours of multi-qubit
systems.

04 Quantum protocols and quantum algorithms,/ch-algorithms,"So far, we've seen various quantum gates and operations, and we've
explored some interesting properties of these gates. Each of these
pages shows how we can combine quantum operations into a quantum
algorithm that outperforms their classical counterpart. As a bonus,
some of these algorithms are actually useful too!

06 Investigating quantum hardware using quantum circuits,/ch-quantum-hardware,"Most gate-based quantum computers share similar challenges with noise
and errors. These pages explore how errors affect quantum circuits, and
how we can mitigate them, without worrying about the physics of the
device itself.

07 Investigating quantum hardware using microwave pulses,/ch-quantum-hardware,"The Qiskit Textbook mostly assumes we have a quantum computer that can
carry out quantum operations, and doesn't worry about how the devices
actually work. These pages go a step deeper, exploring the physics of
superconducting qubits, and using Qiskit to program operations on these
devices at the level of microwave pulses.
